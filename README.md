# Research

*This is a repository of research that is guiding the development of Proxima. We have authored some of these papers for the networking and data layer of our Protocol. Several other papers have been included because they have promising applications in the blockchain data layer.*


The goal of the Proxima Protocol is to create a decentralized blockchain agnostic data layer that provides rich and performant queries on indexed data. In order to accomplish this goal, our research has focused on several areas of interest:

- **Authenticated data structures**
- **Networking**
- **Decentralized payments and authentication**
- **Optimized rollups**

## Other Areas of Interest
Along with the papers we have authored. There are several papers and ideas that we draw inspiration from.

### Optimistic and Zk-Rollups
Optimistic and zk-rollups utilize a chain of state transitions. They can be used to construct fraud proofs, that can be verified by stateless clients.
